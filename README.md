# Webpack-Django HTML Template Loader

The python code in this repository does the very minimum in extracting (actually re-writting) html files generated by webpack to a django html template.

This ensures that all your hashed assets (css, js, png, svg, ....) are properly linked in the django format.

I will repeat, it does the very minimum and yes, it does the job well.

As it is, it works under the following assumptions:

- The f_django python file sits on the same directory as "templates" and webpacks production folder.

- Your python settings file has the following customization:

```python
STATICFILES_DIRS = [
    os.path.join(BASE_DIR, "templates", "prod")
]
```
- From the customization, you realize that webpack generates files to a folder called "prod"

- You may want to execute the build command as:
```
npm run-script build && py f_django.py
```
